# Bibliography Digitalisation Project - Development Log

## Project Overview
Digitising my grandfather's 20,000+ bibliographic entries from 50 Word documents into a searchable database system. Building an ETL pipeline using Python, Claude API, and PostgreSQL with a web interface for editing and keyword management.

**End User**: 89-year-old grandfather who needs an intuitive system to search his extensive book collection.

**Learning Methodology**: Solo development using AI as teaching assistant rather than solution provider. Approach focuses on pseudocode-first design, step-by-step implementation, and understanding each component before proceeding.

## Progress Timeline

### Phase 1: Research & Schema Design ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Challenge: Creating Appropriate Data Structure
**Problem**: Needed to design a JSON schema that could handle diverse bibliographic entries while maintaining data integrity and usability.

**Research Approach**:
- Investigated cataloging standards (MARC, Dublin Core, etc.)
- Analyzed sample entries to identify patterns and edge cases
- Balanced between comprehensive metadata and practical usability

**Key Decisions**:
- Chose JSON over rigid relational structure for flexibility
- Implemented nested person objects for authors/editors/contributors
- Added multivolume support for series and collected works
- Included administrative metadata for tracking parsing quality

**Schema Highlights**:
```json
{
    "authors": [{"family_name": "string", "given_names": "string"}],
    "is_multivolume": "boolean",
    "volumes": [{"volume_number": "integer", "volume_title": "string"}],
    "administrative": {
        "parsing_confidence": "high|medium|low",
        "needs_review": "boolean"
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: Data Analysis & Pipeline Planning ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Challenge: Understanding Source Data Complexity
**Problem**: 50 Word documents with varying formats, entry styles, and structural inconsistencies.

**Analysis Process**:
- Created file analysis script to count entries per document
- Compared files with/without prices to validate entry counts
- Identified files requiring preprocessing before conversion

**Key Findings**:
- Entry counts range from 21 (ZEITSCHRIFTEN.docx) to 954 (FREMDSPRACHIGE LITERATUR)
- Some files may need splitting due to size
- Pricing information inconsistent across files
- Complex multivolume works require special handling

**Files Analysis Results**:
```
Total files: 50
Largest: FREMDSPRACHIGE LITERATUR (954 entries)
Smallest: ZEITSCHRIFTEN (21 entries)
```

### Phase 3: API Integration & Parsing Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Challenge: Structured Data Extraction from Natural Language
**Problem**: Converting free-form bibliographic entries into structured JSON while maintaining accuracy.

**Solution Approach**:
- Integrated Claude API for intelligent text parsing
- Created detailed prompts with schema specifications
- Implemented sample data testing workflow

**Technical Implementation**:
- Used `anthropic` Python package for API integration
- Designed prompts to output valid JSON matching schema
- Created test pipeline with sample entries

**Sample Results**:
Successfully parsed complex entries including:
- Multivolume works (Churchill's WWII memoirs - 6 volumes)
- Edited collections with multiple contributors
- Mixed-language titles and formatting abbreviations

#### Problem-Solving Examples:

**Complex Multivolume Entry**:
```
Input: "CHURCHILL, Winston C. Der Zweite Weltkrieg. Memoiren. 
1. Band Der Sturm zieht auf... [6 volumes total]"

Output: Correctly parsed into structured format with:
- Main work identification
- Individual volume details
- Proper page counts and illustrations metadata
```

**Editor vs. Author Disambiguation**:
```
Input: "EIN GOTT DER KEINER WAR... Mit einem Vorwort von Richard Crossman"

Output: Correctly identified:
- No primary authors
- Richard Crossman and Franz Borkenau as editors
- Multiple contributors (Koestler, Gide, Silone, etc.)
```

### Phase 4: Data Preparation & File Consolidation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Challenge: Reconciling Two Bibliography Versions
**Problem**: Two versions of the same bibliography existed - one with prices and one without. The challenge wasn't just price preservation, but ensuring data integrity when entries might have been moved between topics, edited, or removed entirely between versions.

**Root Cause Understanding**: The "keine preise" (kp) version represented the most current state of the bibliography with grandfather's latest edits and organizational decisions, while the "preise" (p) version contained older price information that needed to be accurately matched back to current entries.

**Key Architectural Decision - Data Sovereignty Rules**:
- **PRIMARY SOURCE (kp)**: Authoritative source for all bibliographic data and structure
- **SECONDARY SOURCE (p)**: Historical source for price information only
- **Strategy**: Use kp as master record, intelligently merge price data where exact matches exist

**Technical Implementation COMPLETED**:
- ‚úÖ Built robust consolidation algorithm handling text normalization and fuzzy matching
- ‚úÖ Implemented exact text matching with intelligent fallback search patterns
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive discrepancy tracking for unmatched entries
- ‚úÖ Built detailed processing metrics and logging for data quality monitoring
- ‚úÖ Successfully processed 16 files with 89% average match rate

**Production Results Achieved**:
```
Files Processed: 16 (xs & s groups)
Total Entries Consolidated: 1,086
Average Match Rate: 89%
Total Discrepancies: 72 entries
Processing Success: 100% file completion rate
```

**Data Engineering Learnings**:
- **Data Provenance Management**: Implementing clear data sovereignty rules for multi-source consolidation
- **Text Matching at Scale**: Building robust normalization pipelines for inexact text matching
- **Quality Metrics Design**: Creating meaningful KPIs for data consolidation processes
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handling partial matches and collecting edge cases for manual review

### Phase 5: Structured Data Extraction & API Integration ‚úÖ MOSTLY COMPLETED

#### Challenge: Transforming 1,000+ Raw Entries into Structured Data
**Problem**: Converting free-form bibliographic text into consistent JSON schema while maintaining data integrity and enabling quality assurance at scale.

**Solution Architecture IMPLEMENTED**:
- ‚úÖ **Batching System**: 25-entry batches with metadata tracking and unique identifiers
- ‚úÖ **API Integration**: Claude API integration with batch processing and rate limit management
- ‚úÖ **Quality Assurance**: Confidence scoring, needs_review flags, and error handling
- ‚úÖ **Production Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging with batch IDs and processing timestamps

**Technical Implementation Highlights**:

**Batch Management System**:
```python
# Sophisticated batch tracking with metadata
{
  "batch_id": "msgbatch_01ABC123...",
  "topic": "normalized_topic_name", 
  "submitted_at": "timestamp",
  "entry_count": 25,
  "status": "completed"
}
```

**API Integration & Error Handling**:
- Implemented robust retry logic and rate limiting
- Built composite ID system (topic_entry_batch) for traceability
- Created batch status tracking with automatic recovery
- Designed structured JSON validation pipeline

**Production Scale Results**:
```
Files Processed: 16 topics (xs & s file groups)
Total Entries Batched: 1,086 entries
Batches Created: ~45 batches
API Integration: Live and processing successfully
Quality Metrics: Confidence scoring implemented
Traceability: Full batch-to-entry lineage tracking
