# Bibliography Digitalisation Project - Development Log

## Project Overview
Digitising my grandfather's 20,000+ bibliographic entries from 50 Word documents into a searchable database system. Building an ETL pipeline using Python, Claude API, and PostgreSQL with a web interface for editing and keyword management.

**End User**: 89-year-old grandfather who needs an intuitive system to search his extensive book collection.

## Progress Timeline

### Phase 1: Research & Schema Design

#### Challenge: Creating Appropriate Data Structure
**Problem**: Needed to design a JSON schema that could handle diverse bibliographic entries while maintaining data integrity and usability.

**Research Approach**:
- Investigated cataloging standards (MARC, Dublin Core, etc.)
- Analyzed sample entries to identify patterns and edge cases
- Balanced between comprehensive metadata and practical usability

**Key Decisions**:
- Chose JSON over rigid relational structure for flexibility
- Implemented nested person objects for authors/editors/contributors
- Added multivolume support for series and collected works
- Included administrative metadata for tracking parsing quality

**Schema Highlights**:
```json
{
    "authors": [{"family_name": "string", "given_names": "string"}],
    "is_multivolume": "boolean",
    "volumes": [{"volume_number": "integer", "volume_title": "string"}],
    "administrative": {
        "parsing_confidence": "high|medium|low",
        "needs_review": "boolean"
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: Data Analysis & Pipeline Planning

#### Challenge: Understanding Source Data Complexity
**Problem**: 50 Word documents with varying formats, entry styles, and structural inconsistencies.

**Analysis Process**:
- Created file analysis script to count entries per document
- Compared files with/without prices to validate entry counts
- Identified files requiring preprocessing before conversion

**Key Findings**:
- Entry counts range from 21 (ZEITSCHRIFTEN.docx) to 954 (FREMDSPRACHIGE LITERATUR)
- Some files may need splitting due to size
- Pricing information inconsistent across files
- Complex multivolume works require special handling

**Files Analysis Results**:
```
Total files: 50
Largest: FREMDSPRACHIGE LITERATUR (954 entries)
Smallest: ZEITSCHRIFTEN (21 entries)
```

### Phase 3: API Integration & Parsing Implementation

#### Challenge: Structured Data Extraction from Natural Language
**Problem**: Converting free-form bibliographic entries into structured JSON while maintaining accuracy.

**Solution Approach**:
- Integrated Claude API for intelligent text parsing
- Created detailed prompts with schema specifications
- Implemented sample data testing workflow

**Technical Implementation**:
- Used `anthropic` Python package for API integration
- Designed prompts to output valid JSON matching schema
- Created test pipeline with sample entries

**Sample Results**:
Successfully parsed complex entries including:
- Multivolume works (Churchill's WWII memoirs - 6 volumes)
- Edited collections with multiple contributors
- Mixed-language titles and formatting abbreviations

#### Problem-Solving Examples:

**Complex Multivolume Entry**:
```
Input: "CHURCHILL, Winston C. Der Zweite Weltkrieg. Memoiren. 
1. Band Der Sturm zieht auf... [6 volumes total]"

Output: Correctly parsed into structured format with:
- Main work identification
- Individual volume details
- Proper page counts and illustrations metadata
```

**Editor vs. Author Disambiguation**:
```
Input: "EIN GOTT DER KEINER WAR... Mit einem Vorwort von Richard Crossman"

Output: Correctly identified:
- No primary authors
- Richard Crossman and Franz Borkenau as editors
- Multiple contributors (Koestler, Gide, Silone, etc.)
```

### Phase 4: Data Preparation & File Consolidation

#### Challenge: Matching Entries Across File Versions
**Problem**: Each topic exists in two versions - one with prices removed ("keine preise") and one with prices ("preise"). Need to consolidate these while preserving price information and handling discrepancies.

**Analysis Findings**:
- Entry counts differ between versions (e.g., Ã„GYPTEN: 76 vs 83 entries)
- Entries should be nearly identical after text normalization
- Some records may have been moved between topics or removed entirely

**Technical Implementation Started**:
- Built consolidation function to process both file versions
- Implemented text normalization (remove prices, clean whitespace)
- Added entry counting logic to determine which version has more entries
- Created base file selection logic (use version with more entries)

**Data Processing Logic**:
```python
# Determine base file (more entries) vs match file
if count_p > count_kp:
    base_entries = entries["p"]
    match_entries = entries["kp"]
else:
    base_entries = entries["kp"]
    match_entries = entries["p"]
```

**Planned Workflow**:
1. Use file with more entries as base
2. Match entries via exact text comparison
3. Merge price information where available
4. Collect discrepancies for later cross-topic analysis
5. Batch final entries (25 per batch) for API parsing
6. Handle moved records after parsing (structured data search)

**Next Implementation Steps**:
- Text matching algorithm for entry consolidation
- Discrepancy collection and handling
- Batch creation for API processing
- Cross-topic moved record detection

**Key Learning**: Strategic decision to handle moved records after parsing using structured data rather than raw text comparison - much more efficient approach.

### Current Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **API**: Claude (Anthropic) for text parsing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (planned)
- **Environment**: Virtual environment with pip
- **Dependencies**: anthropic, python-dotenv

### Key Learning Outcomes
1. **Schema Design**: Balancing flexibility with structure in bibliographic data
2. **API Integration**: Working with LLM APIs for structured data extraction
3. **Data Analysis**: Understanding source data before building pipelines
4. **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking complex parsing into manageable components

### Next Steps (Planned)
- Database schema implementation in PostgreSQL
- Batch processing pipeline for all 50 files
- Error handling and validation systems
- Web interface development
- Keyword management system

### Technical Challenges Solved
1. **Multivolume Handling**: Designed nested structure for complex works
2. **Person Entity Modeling**: Flexible system for authors/editors/contributors
3. **Format Abbreviation Parsing**: Handling German bibliographic conventions
4. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in confidence scoring for parsed entries

### Project Value
- **Personal**: Preserving and making accessible grandfather's lifetime collection
- **Technical**: Full-stack data engineering project with real-world complexity
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates problem-solving, API integration, and database design skills
