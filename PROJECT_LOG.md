# Bibliography Digitalisation Project - Development Log

## Project Overview
Digitising my grandfather's 20,000+ bibliographic entries from 50 Word documents into a searchable database system. Building an ETL pipeline using Python, Claude API, and PostgreSQL with a web interface for editing and keyword management.

**End User**: 89-year-old grandfather who needs an intuitive system to search his extensive book collection.

**Learning Methodology**: Solo development using AI as teaching assistant rather than solution provider. Approach focuses on pseudocode-first design, step-by-step implementation, and understanding each component before proceeding.

## Progress Timeline

### Phase 1: Research & Schema Design ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Challenge: Creating Appropriate Data Structure
**Problem**: Needed to design a JSON schema that could handle diverse bibliographic entries while maintaining data integrity and usability.

**Research Approach**:
- Investigated cataloging standards (MARC, Dublin Core, etc.)
- Analyzed sample entries to identify patterns and edge cases
- Balanced between comprehensive metadata and practical usability

**Key Decisions**:
- Chose JSON over rigid relational structure for flexibility
- Implemented nested person objects for authors/editors/contributors
- Added multivolume support for series and collected works
- Included administrative metadata for tracking parsing quality

**Schema Highlights**:
```json
{
    "authors": [{"family_name": "string", "given_names": "string"}],
    "is_multivolume": "boolean",
    "volumes": [{"volume_number": "integer", "volume_title": "string"}],
    "administrative": {
        "parsing_confidence": "high|medium|low",
        "needs_review": "boolean"
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: Data Analysis & Pipeline Planning ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Challenge: Understanding Source Data Complexity
**Problem**: 50 Word documents with varying formats, entry styles, and structural inconsistencies.

**Analysis Process**:
- Created file analysis script to count entries per document
- Compared files with/without prices to validate entry counts
- Identified files requiring preprocessing before conversion

**Key Findings**:
- Entry counts range from 21 (ZEITSCHRIFTEN.docx) to 954 (FREMDSPRACHIGE LITERATUR)
- Some files may need splitting due to size
- Pricing information inconsistent across files
- Complex multivolume works require special handling

**Files Analysis Results**:
```
Total files: 50
Largest: FREMDSPRACHIGE LITERATUR (954 entries)
Smallest: ZEITSCHRIFTEN (21 entries)
```

### Phase 3: API Integration & Parsing Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Challenge: Structured Data Extraction from Natural Language
**Problem**: Converting free-form bibliographic entries into structured JSON while maintaining accuracy.

**Solution Approach**:
- Integrated Claude API for intelligent text parsing
- Created detailed prompts with schema specifications
- Implemented sample data testing workflow

**Technical Implementation**:
- Used `anthropic` Python package for API integration
- Designed prompts to output valid JSON matching schema
- Created test pipeline with sample entries

**Sample Results**:
Successfully parsed complex entries including:
- Multivolume works (Churchill's WWII memoirs - 6 volumes)
- Edited collections with multiple contributors
- Mixed-language titles and formatting abbreviations

#### Problem-Solving Examples:

**Complex Multivolume Entry**:
```
Input: "CHURCHILL, Winston C. Der Zweite Weltkrieg. Memoiren. 
1. Band Der Sturm zieht auf... [6 volumes total]"

Output: Correctly parsed into structured format with:
- Main work identification
- Individual volume details
- Proper page counts and illustrations metadata
```

**Editor vs. Author Disambiguation**:
```
Input: "EIN GOTT DER KEINER WAR... Mit einem Vorwort von Richard Crossman"

Output: Correctly identified:
- No primary authors
- Richard Crossman and Franz Borkenau as editors
- Multiple contributors (Koestler, Gide, Silone, etc.)
```

### Phase 4: Data Preparation & File Consolidation ‚úÖ MOSTLY COMPLETED

#### Challenge: Matching Entries Across File Versions
**Problem**: Each topic exists in two versions - one with prices removed ("keine preise") and one with prices ("preise"). Need to consolidate these while preserving price information and handling discrepancies.

**Key Architectural Decision - Data Sovereignty Rules**:
- **PRIMARY SOURCE (kp)**: Contains authoritative, most recent data (grandfather's latest edits)
- **SECONDARY SOURCE (p)**: Contains pricing data from older version
- **Strategy**: Always use kp content as base, merge prices from p where matches found

**Technical Implementation COMPLETED**:
- ‚úÖ Built consolidation function processing both file versions
- ‚úÖ Implemented text normalization (remove prices, clean whitespace)
- ‚úÖ Created exact text matching algorithm with fallback search
- ‚úÖ Added discrepancy collection for unmatched p entries
- ‚úÖ Built processing logs with detailed metrics
- ‚úÖ Successfully tested on real data

**Live Testing Results**:
```
Kinder- und Jugendliteratur:
- kp entries: 94, p entries: 93
- Records created: 94, Matches found: 81 (87% match rate)
- Discrepancies: 12

ISLAM:
- kp entries: 66, p entries: 66  
- Records created: 66, Matches found: 61 (92% match rate)
- Discrepancies: 5
```

**Data Processing Logic IMPLEMENTED**:
```python
# Always use kp (keine preise) as authoritative base
base_entries = entries["kp"]
match_entries = entries["p"]

# Text matching with exact comparison + fallback search
# Successful matches: combine kp content + p price
# Unmatched kp entries: keep with price=None
# Unmatched p entries: collect as discrepancies
```

**Current Status**: Core consolidation logic working well with good match rates. Ready for final normalization improvements.

**Next Step**: Refine text normalization for more robust matching before implementing batching system.
